# PacMen Exercise
 MIT xPRO: PacMen Exercise

Project Description:

This exercise was designed to show us how to generate as many PacMen as we want with the push of a button, each button press creating a new div that links to an image file, and once started, moves them at random speeds and directions around the screen, and will bounce off the edges.

How to Run:

You can fork this repository or directly download to your local machine. All you have to do then is load the index.html page in your preferred browser, click Add PacMan as many times as you'd like to generate PacMen, then click Start Game to have them move around the screen. You can keep clicking Add PacMan to keep adding more.

Future Improvements:

The current version of this project includes 4 images for the PacMen, but so far only utilizes one. I'd like to update it so the image switches to its mirror when hits the side of the page, and animates so the mouth opens and closes.
